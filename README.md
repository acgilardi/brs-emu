# BRS-Emulator: BrightScript 2D API Emulator

## The Repository

This repository is a fork from [**BRS**](https://github.com/sjbarag/brs) project, a _command line interpreter_ for **BrightScript** language created by [Sean Barag](https://github.com/sjbarag/). My fork extends **BRS** by implementing the **Draw 2D API** components (`roScreen`, `roCompositor`, `roRegion`, etc.) and several other **BrightScript** components allowing a full channel execution over an **HTML5 Canvas**, including emulation of the Roku remote control. I will keep sending _pull requests_ to the original project, of fixes and implementations done here, so the _interpreter_ can improve and better support this emulator.

### So can I use this to watch TV without a Roku?

Nope! Both projects, **BRS** and **BRS-EMU**, currently has no intention of emulating the Roku OS user interface, integrating with the Roku store, or emulating media content playback.  Although the **BRS-EMU** project runs channels with user interface, it does only support 2D API components, mostly for game development, see [Current Limitations](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/blob/master/docs/limitations.md) page for full details on what is out of scope.

## Technology and Compatibility

This emulator is bundled as a **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** Javascript library that runs as a **[Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)**, and it uses features like [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) and [OffScreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas), that are _bleeding edge_ in the browser engines implementation, because of that, at this moment, it can only be executed in [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) based browsers, like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com/download/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Edge Chromium](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/) or embedded on an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application. 

The **BrightScript Draw 2D API Emulator** is a full client-side library, nothing is sent or processed in the server side. Starting from v0.5.0 Alpha, in addition to the sample **web application**, the release also includes a multi-platform **desktop application** (Windows, Linux & Mac) that uses the same library generated by this project. The desktop app source code is also available at https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu-app. 

## Contributing

There are many ways in which you can participate in the project, read documents below to know the details:

* [How to contribute](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/blob/master/docs/contributing.md)
* [How to build from source](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/blob/master/docs/build-from-source.md)

## Usage

If you just want to try the emulator, not downloading or installing anything, then go to the demo website at: https://lvcabral.com/brs

### Web Application
As mentioned above, this repo provides a sample web appplication for testing the emulator. The application cannot be run as pure HTML page, because some functionalities used by the emulator have security restrictions on the browser engine, so you will need a web server to run the application. For that you can use `Apache` or `IIS` but there is a simpler option if your have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. The steps below consider that option:

* Download the `zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/releases)
* Unzip the package to a folder. 
* Using your OS `terminal` run the commands below inside the `app` directory. 
* As a shortcut you can also use two batch files named `server.sh` and `server.bat` available on `app` folder.
* Linux
    ```
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
    or
    $ sh ./server.sh
    ```
* Windows
    ```
    c:\github\brs-emu\app> python -m http.server 8888
    or 
    c:\github\brs-emu\app> ./server.bat
    ```
* With the webserver running you can now open your Chromium based browser at the page `http://localhost:8888/`

### Desktop Application

You can also run the emulator as a desktop application, download and install the specific OS package from the [latest release](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/releases).

### Games and Demos

You can try the emulator by running one of the demonstration channels included in the repository, these are pre-configured as _clickable icons_ on `index.html`. In addition to those, you can load your own code, either as a single **.brs** file or a channel **.zip package**. Below there is a list of tested games that are publicly available with source code, download the `zip` files and have fun!

### Note for BrightScript Developers

You can see the debug messages from `print` statements in your code using the _browser console_, just make sure you open the _Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+i)_ before loading your channel package or brs file. Exceptions from the emulator will be shown there too. If your code does show an error in some scenario not listed on the [limitations documentation](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/blob/master/docs/limitations.md), feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/issues).
